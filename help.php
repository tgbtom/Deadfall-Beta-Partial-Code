		<u><h2>Concept of Deadfall - Browser Game</h2></u>
		<p class="info">Deadfall is a zombie survival, day/turn-based game. You play the role of a god-like leader of a group of survivors. You are responsible for ensuring that your survivors have a supply of food and water to keep them alive,
			and to build structures that will allow them to survive as long as possible in a world of ever-growing hordes. To be clear: <b>**YOU WILL FAIL - Just a matter of how long it takes**</b>.</p>
			<h5><u>Important Notes for Early Access Testing:</u></h5>
			<li>Towns should be filled from only one username. Towns filled co-operatively will experience game-breaking errors right now.</li>
			<li>When creating a new town, use a simple name without spaces or special characters.</li>
			<li>Many of the structures are still not functional, thus building them provides no actual benefit.</li>
			<li>Some items that can be looted are currently useless.</li>

		<h2><u>BETA - Where to begin?</u></h2>
		<p class="info">If you have found this page, I presume you have been given early-access to Deadfall, for testing purposes. The game is not complete and thus has many bugs of varying severity. The purpose of these tests
		are to find flaws in the general foundations that have been created for the game. It is important to note that registration is not currently open, to access your early-access account; you will have received a temporary username and password that you
		can use to log-in. If this is the case, please read on so you may understand how to play the game, before signing in to test it. If you already know how to play, you may now log-in <a href="http://tom.sfosquad.com/deadfall/">here!</a></p>
		<p class="info">When you first login you will be presented with a page to browse all of your characters. If this is your first time then you will see a page as portrayed in <u><i>image 1</i></u>. For testing purposes, towns have been established 
		as a maximum of 10 survivors (no more and no less). To fully test the game, proceed by creating 10 characters, each with unique names: as seen in <u><i>image 2</i></u>.  <b>NOTE: Classes currently have no functionality, thus the class you select will make no difference.</b></p>

		<h3><u>I've Created my Characters, Now What?</u></h3>
		<p class="info">Select each character individually and the dialog box on the right hand side should pop-up with an option to either "join town" if they are not in a town, or "play town" if they have already joined a town. When you first press "join town" you will see a list of currently available towns to join. For testing; 
		<i><b>it is important only to join a town that you have created.</b></i> If you have not already created a town, proceed by entering a town name <b>**With no spaces**</b> and press create. Now when selecting to join a town as a character, you should see your newly created town as one of your options.</p>
