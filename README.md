# Deadfall-Beta-Partial-Code
Partial code for Deadfall, Browser-Based Zombie Survival


This code has all been programmed from scratch using a basic text-editor (Notepad++), solely by myself
The code is for a browser-based zombie survival game. Currently set up for private beta-testing, thus not all code is supplied in this git.
The code supplied here will also not function without a database tailored to the specified structure.
If you are interested in seeing the code in action, or getting a default loadout for the database, send me a message at tgbtom_20@hotmail.com
